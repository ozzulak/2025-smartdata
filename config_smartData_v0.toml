# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

intro_and_consent = """## Welcome to our the first DataDonation exploration study bot.

In this task youâ€™re going to engage with a prototype chatbot. It will ask you imagine how you, as a researcher, could benefit from datasets data donations that young provide. 

*How could this look like?* 
The data donation platform will hold data from hundreds of youth, who will have provided time-series data on their social media use, the websites they visit, as well as potentially self-report of their mood and wellbeing.

In what follows, we will want to create a simple story: if this were available, how could you use it? What is the most powerful study you can imagine you would love to run if you had this data; but cannot run without it?

Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
